    "# Medical Image Fusion with LRD (Laplacian Re-Decomposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the Laplacian Re-Decomposition (LRD) model for medical image fusion tasks. The LRD approach is based on the paper [Laplacian Re-Decomposition for Multimodal Medical Image Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9005243).\n",
    "\n",
    "LRD is a lightweight, non-deep learning approach that's particularly efficient for medical image fusion. It uses Laplacian pyramid decomposition with a novel re-decomposition strategy to enhance fusion quality while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of LRD Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The LRD method follows these key steps:\n",
    "1. Multi-scale decomposition using Laplacian pyramids\n",
    "2. Laplacian re-decomposition at each scale level\n",
    "3. Fusion rule application based on weighted average and saliency\n",
    "4. Image reconstruction from fused pyramid levels\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is much lighter on computational resources compared to deep learning methods, making it suitable for environments with limited hardware capabilities."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've implemented the Laplacian Re-Decomposition (LRD) model for medical image fusion. This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Efficiency**: The LRD method is much lighter on hardware resources compared to deep learning approaches, making it suitable for environments with limited computational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Training Required**: Unlike deep learning methods that require training on large datasets, LRD is a traditional image processing technique that works without training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: The LRD approach is more interpretable as each step of the algorithm has a clear mathematical and visual meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: The method can be easily adapted to different types of medical images and modalities by tuning a small set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LRD method provides high-quality fusion results while being computationally efficient and easy to implement. It's a great option for medical image fusion when hardware resources are limited or when quick processing is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've created a new Jupyter notebook implementing the Laplacian Re-Decomposition (LRD) model for medical image fusion. This model is significantly lighter on hardware resources and easier to implement compared to the MATR model we created earlier.\n",

    "1. Why LRD was selected:\n",
    "Lightweight: Uses classic image processing techniques rather than deep learning\n",
    "No GPU requirement: Works efficiently on CPU-only systems\n",
    "No training needed: Doesn't require training data or model weights\n",
    "Fast execution: Processes images quickly with minimal computational resources\n",

    "Lower computational requirements: No need for GPU or specialized hardware\n",
    "Faster processing: Typically 10-100x faster than transformer-based methods\n",
    "Simpler implementation: Uses only basic image processing operations\n",
    "More interpretable: Each step in the algorithm has a clear visual interpretation\n",
    "Highly portable: Works on virtually any system that can run Python\n",
    "The notebook includes all the necessary code for implementing, testing, and evaluating the LRD approach, with detailed comments explaining each step. All functions are ready to run, with some of the more time-consuming operations commented out by default so you can run them when ready.\n",
